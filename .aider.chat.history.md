In "GUESS THE CORRUPT," players take the role of an investigator attending a political corruption hearing. During the hearing, players are presented with evidence about various politicians—such as their official salary, unexplained wealth, lifestyle, and testimonies—and must determine whether each politician is corrupt. The courtroom setting adds tension and realism, making each decision feel like a critical judgment call.

Hearing-Themed Game Mechanics:
Hearing Room Interface: The screen simulates a formal hearing room with a podium, judge or panel, and lawyer or witness stands where evidence and politicians’ profiles appear.

Evidence Presentation: Information is given as pieces of evidence presented by the lawyer or witness, e.g., salary reports, bank statements, audio clips from whistleblowers, or video testimonies.

Questioning Rounds: Players can ask limited questions or request clarifications during their turn to gather more info.

Time to Judge: Each politician's case has a countdown timer to simulate the hearing process pressure.

Decision Deliberation: After reviewing evidence, players must declare "Corrupt" or "Not Corrupt" to the panel.

Score and Feedback: Panel members provide feedback based on the player’s judgment, awarding points for accuracy and insightful questioning.

Case Complexity: Cases grow more complex with multiple evidence pieces and contradictory testimonies as levels advance.

Narrative Elements: Include occasional dramatic courtroom events like surprises, objections, or last-minute evidence.

Educational Interludes: Between cases, short facts about corruption laws and real hearing procedures are shared.

This courtroom hearing concept adds drama and immersion, encouraging players to think critically as if they were part of an actual corruption investigation


App Functionality
Smooth Interactive UI: An intuitive hearing room interface with clear navigation between evidence, questioning, and decision screens.

Dynamic Evidence Management: Randomized evidence pools for politicians to offer replayability and unpredictability.

Timer and Scoring System: Real-time countdowns during hearings keep gameplay engaging, with scores based on accuracy and speed.

Hint and Question Features: Limited but strategic use of hints and questions enhances decision-making without trivializing the challenge.

Leaderboard and Progress Tracking: Track player progress, highest scores, and improvement over time to encourage competition.

Multiplatform Compatibility: Optimized for mobile and web to maximize accessibility.

Idea Quality and Originality
Unique Hearing Setting: The courtroom-style political hearing backdrop is rare in quiz or corruption-themed games, adding immersive context and dramatic tension.

Evidence-based Judgment: Instead of simple yes/no questions, players analyze layered evidence, incorporate questioning rounds, and make informed decisions.

Educational Integration: Seamless learning moments via factual pop-ups and real-case-inspired scenarios enhance value beyond entertainment.

Narrative Flow: Inclusion of objections, surprise evidence, and witness testimonies creates a narrative arc uncommon in mini games.

Social Sharing: Encourage players to share verdicts or high scores, sparking discussions on corruption awareness.

User Experience
Engagement Through Role Play: Players feel like active participants in a thrilling hearing rather than passive quiz takers.

Adaptive Difficulty: Balances challenge with accessibility, easing in new players and rewarding advanced users with complex cases.

Visual and Audio Design: Realistic courtroom visuals, ambient sounds (gavel hits, murmurs), and impactful alerts build immersion.

Clear Feedback: Immediate and constructive feedback from the panel helps players learn and improve.

Short Sessions: Designed for quick rounds to suit casual play while providing depth for longer engagement.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this new file to generate the app logo.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Game Prompt:
"You are in a political hearing. Review the basic information about the politician — including their monthly salary and declared wealth. Decide if they are CORRUPT or NOT CORRUPT."
Simple Mechanics:
Display politician profile with clear, concise info.
Two buttons at the bottom of the screen:
"CORRUPT"
"NOT CORRUPT"
Player taps one button to submit their guess.
If the guess is correct, the screen briefly flashes green or displays a positive confirmation.
If the guess is wrong, the entire screen background turns red for 1-2 seconds to indicate the incorrect choice.
After the feedback, automatically proceed to the next politician profile.
Keep score of correct guesses.
Optionally, add a timer bar for extra challenge on each guess.

I need to know which file contains the game prompt text so I can shorten it to 3‑4 sentences.  
Please add that file to the chat.

The changes you’re describing will need to be made in the component that renders the game screen.  
The most likely files that will need edits are:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – the main page that currently shows the game UI.  
2. `mini-app/components/game.tsx` (if it exists) – a dedicated component that contains the game logic and UI.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
