+Evidence Presentation: Information is given as pieces of evidence presented by the lawyer or witness, e.g., salary reports, bank statements, audio clips from whistleblowers, or video testimonies.
+
+Questioning Rounds: Players can ask limited questions or request clarifications during their turn to gather more info.
+
+Time to Judge: Each politician's case has a countdown timer to simulate the hearing process pressure.
+
+Decision Deliberation: After reviewing evidence, players must declare "Corrupt" or "Not Corrupt" to the panel.
+
+Score and Feedback: Panel members provide feedback based on the player’s judgment, awarding points for accuracy and insightful questioning.
+
+Case Complexity: Cases grow more complex with multiple evidence pieces and contradictory testimonies as levels advance.
+
+Narrative Elements: Include occasional dramatic courtroom events like surprises, objections, or last-minute evidence.
+
+Educational Interludes: Between cases, short facts about corruption laws and real hearing procedures are shared.
+
+This courtroom hearing concept adds drama and immersion, encouraging players to think critically as if they were part of an actual corruption investigation
